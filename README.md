# Camera Software for OSS README

## Overview

Welcome to the Camera Software for OSS! This Python-based software seamlessly integrates with your cameras, capturing real-time availability information of sports spaces and sending it to the OSS.

## Features

- **Real-Time Availability:** Capture and transmit real-time data on the availability of sports spaces.

- **Integration:** Easy integration with various camera systems.

- **Authentication:** Secured by an authentication token obtained from OSS admin.

- **Data Security:** Ensure the security and privacy of captured data during transmission.

- **Raspberry Pi Compatibility:** Supports both Raspberry Pi camera (`F`) and other cameras (`T`).
